             <h2 id="Head1"> Microsoft</h2>
             <p>In the world of computers, there are few names as well known as that of Bill Gates, the founder of what  is today known as microsoft. The day was April 4, 1975, two friends, the aforementioned Bill Gates, and Paul Allen created Microsoft. This company was first started in order to produce software for an early PC known as the Altair 8800. By the end of 1978, just three years after its founding, the sales for Microsoft topped more than 1,000,000 dollars in revenue. The company later went on to license its MS-DOS OS for their first PC. By 1985, Microsoft released a brand new OS known as Windows, which finally has a GUI unlike the MS-DOS that required the users to use commands in order to open a program. By the late 1980s, Microsoft became the world’s biggest PC software company based on sales and continued to roll out more Operating Systems from Windows 95 to Windows 11.</p> <a href= "https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/microsoft-founded"> Microsoft</a>
             <h2 id="Head2"> Personal Computers</h2> 
             <p> here was a time when computers were so large that they filled an entire room. Absolutely insane especially when you compare that time to know when people have them in their pockets. The first PC was made by a small firm called MITS. The computer's name was the Altair and it used Intel’s 8080 microprocessor that was developed in 1974. While the computer was popular among computer nerds, the commercial appeal was limited. The giant  industry of personal computers didn’t truly begin until 1977 with the Apple II, the Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80, and the Commodore Business Machines PET. All of these machines were able to be bought by individuals, businesses, and schools. In 1981, IBM Corporation entered the market with the IBM PC. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and its GUI became the basis of their Macintosh PC. By the year 2000, nearly half of all households in the US owned a computer. Even now, computers are still steadily advancing and becoming more powerful.</p>

               <h2 id="Head3">C++</h2>
             <p>Back in 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup was doing work for his Ph.D. thesis. He was working with a language called Simula, a language designed primarily for simulations. The Simula 67 language is regarded as the very first language that supported object-oriented programming paradigm and while Stroustrup found it very useful for software development, it was much too slow for any practical use. And thus, he began his work on “C with Classes”, the superset of the C language. The first C with Classes compiler  was call Cfront derived from a C compiler called CPre. The program was made to translate C with Classes code into ordinary C. Cfront was also a self hosting compiler due to the fact that it was written mostly in C with Classes and it was later abandoned in 1993 due to its inability to have new features easily integrated into it. 1983, C with Classes is now known as C++. Many new features were added to this language including virtual functions and function overload. Now C++ is a widely used language that millions of developers and programmers reap the benefits of.</p>

             <h2 id="Head4">The GPU</h2>
             <p>The graphics processing unit is a key component of PC architecture today. Its role in gaming and even some more general computing is undeniable. In the 1980s, there was no gpu, not as we know it today at least. IBM created and introduced to the world the MDA which features a single monochrome text mode allowing high-res text and symbol display at 80 x 25 characters. It did not, however, support graphics of any kind. Just a year later, Hercules Computer Technology introduced the HGC (Hercules Graphics Card) which integrated IBM’s MDA display standard with a bitmapped graphics mode. In 1983, just two years later, Intel released the iSBX 275 Video Graphics Controller Multimodule Board capable of displaying 8 unique colors at 256 x 256 res. IBM created the first graphics card with cull color display just after the release of the MDA Video display cards. Skipping forward some years to the late 1990s, NVIDIA created the term GPU and shaped the entire future of modern graphics processing through the release of the GeForce 256. Even today NVIDIA is still one of the forerunners of the GPU market and is continuing to push the limits.<p>

             <h2 id="Head5">The CPU</h2>
             <p>CPUs are continuing to become more powerful as the wants and needs of gamers, designers, streamers, and developers grow. The ability for the CPU to meet these ever growing demands started with the transistor. The ETL Mark III was the first stored-program transistor computer and was created by Japan’s Electrotechnical Laboratory in 1956. In the 1960s the development of electronic clocks and calculators assisted in making integrated circuits practical and by the late 60s the first chips for calculators and computers showed that small computers can be made possible with large-scale integration. Through this, the microprocessor was eventually invented. The very first commercial microprocessor was released by Busicom and Intel in 1971. By the 1990s, Intel introduces their original Pentium microprocessor and the Pentium Pro which later becomes the foundation for Pentium II, III, M, and Intel Core architectures. The market of CPUs only grows as more tech companies create.<p>
